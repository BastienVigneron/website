Biscuit is an open-source, token-based authentication and authorization system.  

With Biscuit, you can:

- allow decentralized verification through public key cryptography
- allow offline attenuation where, from each token, a new one with less rights can be generated 
- create strong security policy enforcement based on a logic language
- revoke tokens and all the tokens attenuated from them

Biscuit can be used with the command line and is implemented in Rust, Haskell, Go, Java, WebAssembly and C.
