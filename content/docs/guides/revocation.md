## Revocation identifiers

Biscuit tokens are bearer tokens. Revoking bearer tokens is usually done through revocation lists: a list of
tokens that are no longer accepted is shared with all verifying parties. When authorizing a biscuit token,
the library will make sure the token has not been revoked.

Such a mechanism relies on being able to uniquely identify tokens: we want to be able to revoke only the tokens
that are not valid anymore, without revoking other tokens (even tokens with the same payload but have been issued
to another holder). With offline attenuation, biscuits introduce another constraint: revoking a token should also
revoke all derived tokens (else it would be trivial to circument revocation).

The biscuit spec (and libraries) provide you with:

 - a way to uniquely identify tokens (two biscuits with the same payload and secret key will be different)
 - a way to identify groups of tokens derived from the same parent token
 - a way to reject tokens based on their ids during authorization

The biscuit spec _does not mandate_ how to publish revoked ids within your system;
that depends a lot on the architecture and constraints of the systems.
You can start simple with static revocation lists read through environment variables, and migrate to more complex systems as needed.

### Listing revocation ids for a token

The [CLI](../../Usage/cli/#verify-a-token) can be used to inspect revocation ids:

```
‚ùØ biscuit inspect test9_expired_token.bc --raw-input
Authority block:
== Datalog ==

== Revocation id ==
16d0a9d7f3d29ee2112d67451c8e4ff07bd5366a6cdb082cf4fcb66e6d15a57a22009ef1018fc4d0f9184edb0900df161807bc6f8287275f32eae6b5b1c57100

==========

Block n¬∞1:
== Datalog ==

check if time($date), $date <= 2018-12-20T00:00:00+00:00;
