## Why should we plan for token revocation?

There are two competing approaches to session management in authorization, that will drive
architectural decisions:
- in *stateful* systems, all authorizations are performed through one service or database
that holds the list of currently active sessions
- in *stateless* systems, authorization can be performed independently in any service, only
using information from the token and the service. In particular, the service cannot know
about all of the currently active sessions

Those two solutions are often compared on their ability to close a session. Why? Can't we
just set an expiration date? Even with expiration date we would still need a way to close
a session, to implement the log out functionality. That feature is common, expected by users,
and needed in multiple situations (public computer, disconnecting sessions from a stolen
phone...)?

In stateful systems, closing a session is easy: delete the session's information from the
database and that's it. In stateless systems, this is more complex: how do we make sure
all services know that the session is invalid? That means reintroducing some shared state,
so is the stateless design impossible after all? Shouldn't we go back to stateful systems?

If the architecture we are designing can rely on a central state, it will be the simplest
approach and probably the right solution. But there are good reasons to choose the stateless
design:
- **scaling**: a central authorization service that is queried on every request is a single point
of failure for the entire system. If it is down, nobody can log in, but existing sessions will
fail too. A stateless approach will decouple session creation from authorization, so existing
sessions can still work when the authentication service fails.
- **isolation**: the service receiving the request might be less trusted and should not be
able to access session information.
- **authentication delegation**: authentication could be in a separate service (example: SSO)
that can't be queried on every request. That service could even be managed by a different
company.

In those cases, separating authorization from session creation makes sense, but then how do
we close a session? It is usually done through token revocation: the authorizer needs to
know a list of tokens that must be refused, and that list changes dynamically, so we are
reintroducing some state in the system.

But revocation has properties that make it nice to implement in stateless architectures:
- we do not need to know about all of the tokens, only those that were revoked, which will
be much smaller
- the list of revoked tokens will naturally grow, but if tokens have an expiration date, they
can be purged from the list after a while
- it is read-oriented and highly cacheable: once a token was added to the revocation list,
we won't modify its entry (except when purging), so we don't need synchronization or consensus
- revocation lists do not hold any critical or private information, they can be shared with
every service

TODO:
expiration tips: short expiration with regular token exchange
do not limit tokens per IP but per world region and per user agent: IP can change a lot in 
a session(mobile, etc) but sessions rarely jump quickly over the world or change user agent


## Revocation identifiers

Biscuit tokens are bearer tokens. Revoking bearer tokens is usually done through revocation lists: a list of
tokens that are no longer accepted is shared with all verifying parties. When authorizing a biscuit token,
the library will make sure the token has not been revoked.

Such a mechanism relies on being able to uniquely identify tokens: we want to be able to revoke only the tokens
that are not valid anymore, without revoking other tokens (even tokens with the same payload but have been issued
to another holder). With offline attenuation, biscuits introduce another constraint: revoking a token should also
revoke all derived tokens (else it would be trivial to circument revocation).

The biscuit spec (and libraries) provide you with:

 - a way to uniquely identify tokens (two biscuits with the same payload and secret key will be different)
 - a way to identify groups of tokens derived from the same parent token
 - a way to reject tokens based on their ids during authorization

The biscuit spec _does not mandate_ how to publish revoked ids within your system;
that depends a lot on the architecture and constraints of the systems.
You can start simple with static revocation lists read through environment variables, and migrate to more complex systems as needed.

### Listing revocation ids for a token

The [CLI](../../Usage/cli/#verify-a-token) can be used to inspect revocation ids:

```
‚ùØ biscuit inspect test9_expired_token.bc --raw-input
Authority block:
== Datalog ==

== Revocation id ==
